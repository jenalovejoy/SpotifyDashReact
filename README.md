# So far:
## Start with jenalovejoy/spotify dashboard && create-react-app
Goal: to translate appending jquery into react components from my [previous work](github.com/jenalovejoy/spotifydashboard)

## New learnings
- Using React with Typescript
- Using existing packages for [authorization](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-spotify-auth) and [api calls](https://github.com/JMPerez/spotify-web-api-js/tree/master/src)
- More comfortable with state / props

## Up next
- Rendering Bar Graph component from previous work using React
- Finding additional options for visualization
- Snazzy design
